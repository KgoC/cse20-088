      <p style="word-break: break-all;justify-content: center; text-align: center;color: black; margin-left: -170px; margin-top: 50px">Amsterdam was established as a fishing town around the thirteenth century. Amsterdam developed round a dam in the Amstel stream toward the finish of the twelfth century. The name Amstelledamme happens without precedent for the cost concession of Floris V, Tally of Holland, dated October 27, 1275. To shield themselves from floods, the early occupants needed to construct barriers on the two sides of the stream, and around 1270 they assembled a dam between these embankments.<br>The city quickly expanded its business, and in 1489, as an indication of appreciation for the help given by the city to the Burgundian-Austrian rulers, Head Maximilian the first permitted Amsterdam to decorate its armorial orientation with the majestic crown. By then Holland's most noteworthy business town and port, just as the storehouse of the northern Netherlands, Amsterdam had gotten a focal point of abundance and impact in Europe.</p>
